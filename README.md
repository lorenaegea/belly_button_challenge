Module 14 Challenge - Georgia Institute of Technology Data Science and Analytics Boot Camp

Built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs) that colonize human navels.
Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in the selected individual.
Generated a bubble chart that displays the abundance of each each microbial culture found in the selected individual.
Presented selected individual's metadata in a demographic information panel.
Designed a gauge chart to plot the weekly washing frequency of the selected individual.
